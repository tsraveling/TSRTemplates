TSRTemplates
============

A collection of Xcode file templates I use to make development easier.

To use:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Create this folder, if it doesn't already exist: **~/Libary/Developer/Xcode/Templates/**
3. Copy **File Templates** and **Project Templates** into the folder you've just created.
4. You're done! TSRTemplates will now show up in the sidebar when you create a new Xcode project or file.
